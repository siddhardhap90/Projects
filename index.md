# Banking Data Analytics Project

As a demonstration of my data analysis proficiency, I have embarked on a banking data analytics project. This endeavor serves to practice and exhibit my skills in data science, particularly in the context of financial risk assessment and optimization. Below are the key questions that will guide my research and analysis:

1. **Predicting Loan Defaults**: How can we improve predictions on customer loan defaults?
2. **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Is it possible to dynamically adjust risk profiles based on customer behavior and economic indicators?
3. **Interconnected Risk**: How are various financial activities and the likelihood of default interrelated?
4. **Stress Testing**: Can our predictive models withstand extreme economic scenarios?
5. **Optimization of Lending Portfolio**: How can we optimize the bank’s lending portfolio for maximum return on investment with minimal risk?

## In-Depth Look at Predicting Loan Defaults

The first question I am tackling is the prediction of loan defaults. The steps I will undertake to address this question include:

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: The dataset, sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients), will be loaded and cleaned to ensure quality analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I will perform a thorough exploratory analysis to understand underlying patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: I plan to engineer features that could enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models.
- **Model Building**: Various predictive models will be built and tested to find the most effective one for our purpose.
- **Evaluation**: Each model’s performance will be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Finally, I will extract insights and make recommendations based on the model outcomes.

### This work is being done on jupyter notebooks on the google colab environment. 

I begin by loading the necessary python libraries

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
